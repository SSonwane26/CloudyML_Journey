### How Internships Work at CloudyML? (The Real Deal)
Wanna get into their internship program? Here’s the brutal truth—no sugarcoating.

**Eligibility? Simple (But Not Easy)**

* Finish ALL modules related to your role (Data Analyst/Scientist/etc.).
* Complete ALL assignments, case studies, projects—no half-assing.
* Polish your resume (No typos, no fluff).
* Apply & wait for CloudyML to verify your work.

Only then—**GREEN SIGNAL**—you can schedule your interview.

**The Interview Rounds (Survival Mode ON)**

Two rounds of "prove you didn’t just binge-watch tutorials":

Round 1: Coding (SQL + Python)

* SQL: Joins, subqueries, window functions—expect real-world problems.
* Python: Pandas, data cleaning, maybe a LeetCode-style question.

Round 2: Excel + Power BI

* Excel: Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros—they WILL test shortcuts.
* Power BI: DAX, dashboards, "explain your thought process" questions.

**What If You Fail? (The Retake Rules)**

* Score <5/10? Cool-off period of 5-10 days (Study harder, bro).
* Unlimited retakes—but miss a scheduled interview?
    * 30-day LOCK-IN (No rescheduling before that).

**My journey?**

* Round 1: Took 3 attempts (SQL kicked my ass the first two times).
* Round 2: Cleared in 2 tries (Power BI saved me).

**Finally, INTERNSHIP! (What’s Next?)**

Two real-world projects to crush:

Project 1: Python/Problem-Solving

  * Coding, debugging, logic-building—prove you’re not just a "tutorial guy".

Project 2: Power BI/Storytelling
  
  * Dashboards + "business insights"—because fancy visuals mean nothing without context.

**Next Up?**

I’ll break down [Project1]() & [Project2]() in detail— mistakes, learnings, and how I survived. Stay tuned!
