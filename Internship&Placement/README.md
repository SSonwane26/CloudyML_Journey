### How Internships Work at CloudyML? (The Real Deal)
Wanna get into their internship program? Here’s the brutal truth—no sugarcoating.

**The Internship Journey Begins: How I Finally Joined CloudyML’s Internship Program**

After wrapping up all the modules, projects, and mock interviews, I was pumped — ready to prove my skills in the real world. But there was one final gate to pass: **the internship eligibility criteria.**

At CloudyML, they don’t just hand out internships like freebies. You have to *earn* it.

### ✅ Internship Eligibility Checklist:

* Complete **all modules** related to your chosen role (in my case, Data Analyst)
* Submit **every assignment** (even the ones you almost forgot)
* Finish and upload **all case studies/projects**
* Share your **updated resume**
* THEN apply for the internship round

Once submitted, the CloudyML team does a thorough check. If everything looks good, they give you the **green signal** to proceed — not unlike a job screening process.

And then the real challenge begins...

### ⚔️ Internship Selection Process – 2 Rounds of Battle

1. **Round 1: Coding Round**
   Focus: **SQL + Python**
   This round tests your logic, query-writing, problem-solving — and your patience.

2. **Round 2: Business Tools Round**
   Focus: **MS Excel + Power BI**
   Think dashboards, formulas, DAX, and storytelling with data.

**If you pass both rounds — Congratulations, you’re in!** 🎉
But if not? Don't worry — *you get unlimited tries.*

Let me explain…

### 🔁 What Happens If You Fail a Round?

If you don’t clear a round, you enter a **cool-down period**, like a video game.

* Suppose you score **5/10** in SQL+Python — you wait about **7 days** before your next attempt.
* Same logic applies for the second round.
* No pass limit. You can try again and again — *until you make it.*

BUT — and this is important — if you **miss your scheduled interview**, you're locked out for **30 days**. Ouch. Lesson: don’t ghost your interview slot!

### My Journey (Real Talk 😅)

Let me be honest — it wasn’t a smooth ride for me.

* **Round 1 (SQL + Python):** Took me **3 attempts**
* **Round 2 (Excel + Power BI):** Took **2 attempts**

Each time I failed, I took that "rest period" to brush up my skills, practice more, and learn from my mistakes. CloudyML doesn’t rush you — they give you the time and support to get better.

And finally, on a day I’ll never forget, I cleared both rounds and officially became a **CloudyML Intern**. 🥳

### 🧑‍💻 Internship Projects – Hands-On, Real-World, No Nonsense

Once inside, the training wheels come off. You're given **two real-world projects** to sharpen your tools:

#### 🔧 **Project 1: [Porter](https://github.com/SSonwane26/CloudyML_Journey/blob/main/Internship%26Placement/Project%20One/README.md#about-project)**

* Domain: **Logistics & Trucking Startup**
* Focus: **Python, programming, and problem-solving**
* Tasks: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and deriving insights to solve logistics problems

#### 📊 **Project 2: [Ola Cabs](https://github.com/SSonwane26/CloudyML_Journey/blob/main/Internship%26Placement/Project%20Two/README.md#about-project)**

* Domain: **Ride-Hailing Service (Uber’s rival)**
* Focus: **Power BI, Data Visualization & Storytelling**
* Tasks: Building dashboards, trend analysis, and creating visual narratives for business decisions

Each project feels like working inside a real data team. You analyze, build, and present — just like a real analyst.

### 📌 Final Thoughts: Why This Journey Mattered

* I didn’t come from a data background.
* I didn’t have a degree in analytics or CS.
* But I had consistency, guidance, and a roadmap that worked.

Thanks to **CloudyML**, what started with confusion turned into clarity — and confidence.

Now I’m building a portfolio, growing my skills, and preparing for full-time opportunities with real experience on my resume.
