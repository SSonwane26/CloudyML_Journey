### How I Join CLOUDYML

**From Rejections to Resolution: My 8-Month Journey into Data Analytics with CloudyML**

Once upon a recent time — somewhere between dozens of job rejections and a bucket full of LinkedIn "We regret to inform you..." messages — I found myself asking a tough question:

*"Am I really ready for a Data Analyst role?"*

Let’s be honest. I’d done internships, built a few projects here and there, and even aced a couple of YouTube crash courses on data stuff. But when I started applying for full-time, on-site roles, reality hit harder than an Excel VLOOKUP error — my fundamentals were shaky, and I had no structured roadmap.

**Act 1: The Search for the Perfect Course**

So began my quest — not for the Holy Grail, but something equally elusive: a budget-friendly, *structured* data analytics course. Enter: **CloudyML**.

I’d already joined their Telegram group (which, by the way, is like Hogwarts for data aspirants — daily Q\&As, job alerts, and surprisingly good memes). One day, I filled out a simple form on their website. A few hours later, I got a call that felt more like a lifeline. We spoke for almost 30–40 minutes, where they patiently answered all my questions — even the silly ones like “Will I become job-ready in 3 months?” (Spoiler: Nope, but you’ll thank yourself later.)

They had three main courses:

1. **Data Analytics Program** – too basic (mostly on YouTube),
2. **Data Science and Analytics Program** – just right (advanced, with ML & cloud services),
3. **Data Superstar Program** – a full buffet with Data Engineering, which felt like ordering a pizza with pineapple. Not for me. Not now.

So, on **14 March 2024**, I paid **₹13,159** and officially started the **Data Science and Analytics Program**. That was Day 1.

**Act 2: The Orientation Saga (Where I Met My Teaching Assistant... Online)**

The course began with an introduction:

* How to ask doubts without feeling judged (hello, webchat support!)
* How to download assignments (and not forget them in your Downloads folder forever)
* Where to upload those assignments (and yes, uploading is mandatory for certificates)
* How to build a killer resume and a LinkedIn profile that doesn’t scream “entry-level but desperate”
* And even mock interview prep, including HR questions that begin with “Tell me about yourself...” (ugh).

**Act 3: The Learning Odyssey – Module by Module**

### 🐍 Python

From basic syntax to complex case studies, I learned it all:

* Data structures, loops, regex, pandas, numpy
* EDA & data cleaning
* Regular coding practice on HackerRank & LeetCode (tears were shed)
* And finally, Python-based projects and a certificate that felt like a medal of honor.

### 🧮 Excel (aka The Unsung Hero)

Trust me, Excel deserves more respect. I dove into:

* Charts, pivots, slicers, formulas (SUMIF, INDEX-MATCH, VLOOKUP… you name it!)
* Macros and VBA (yes, I recorded my own macro like a pro)
* Dashboard creation, with interactive cards and AI add-ins
* Ended with a real-world case study and another shiny certificate.

### 🧠 SQL (Where Queries Become Conversations)

Ah, SQL — the language of data. I covered:

* Joins, subqueries, CTEs, views, stored procedures
* DDL, DML, window functions, RANK, NTILE
* Pareto analysis, rolling windows, and even pseudo code-based case studies
* After tons of practice, I could finally write queries without Googling every other word!

### 📊 Power BI (My Favorite Visual Toy)

* Charts, slicers, filters, DAX formulas (SUMX vs SUM, oh boy!)
* M language, row-level security (including dynamic access)
* Star and snowflake schemas, AI-powered visuals
* Connected data from SQL, web, and even OData

### 📈 Tableau (Just the Basics, Thank You)

Power BI was enough, but I got the basics of Tableau:

* Plots, filters, parameters, dashboards, joins
* Enough to not look lost if someone mentions "LOD expressions"

### 📐 Statistics (The Brainy Part)

As a future analyst, I focused on stats:

* Mean, median, mode, distributions, probability
* Hypothesis testing, z-test, t-test, chi-square, ANOVA
* Central Limit Theorem (not a Marvel villain)
* And concepts like skewness, kurtosis, degrees of freedom — now my friends, not foes.

**Act 4: The Final Stretch – Projects, Revisions & Realization**

Once I finished the modules, I moved into what I call “The War Room Phase”:

* Daily revision of one module
* Building one project per tool: Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel
* Practicing mock interviews
* Polishing my resume and LinkedIn every weekend like a sacred ritual
* Every 8–9 days, I’d explore bonus modules like ML basics, Google Data Studio, or Aptitude training.

**Act 5: The Breakthrough – Internship and Placement**

Eight months later, I applied for the internship — and guess what?

**I got in.**

It wasn’t magic. It wasn’t luck. It was showing up every single day, submitting assignments, asking questions, and doing the work — even when I didn’t feel like it.

**Epilogue: Lessons I’d Share with My Past Self (and Maybe You)**

* **Structured learning** matters. YouTube is great, but it won’t hold you accountable.
* **Consistency beats intensity.** One hour every day is better than ten hours once a week.
* **Certificates don’t get jobs — skills do.** But yes, the certificates help keep your motivation up.
* **Mentorship makes a difference.** Having TAs, WhatsApp communities, and live doubt sessions kept me from feeling lost.

So here I am, telling my story not from a place of “arrival” but as a fellow traveler.

Because whether you’re starting now, restarting, or doubting yourself mid-journey — remember: it’s not about how fast you go, but that you don’t stop.

*And if I can do it, so can you.*
