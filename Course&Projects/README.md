### How I Join CLOUDYML
Here’s my journey—from joining the course to securing a placement. I’ll share my experiences: how I enrolled, the fee structure, why I chose this particular course over other options, the modules covered, internship eligibility, and placement criteria.

It all started when I connected with the CloudyML team. After completing multiple internships and working on projects (both individually and during internships), I had gained exposure to different domains. However, when I began applying for on-site Data Analyst roles, I faced repeated rejections. The reason? My foundational knowledge in data analytics was weak, and I lacked a structured learning path.

This pushed me to look for a budget-friendly yet effective course, and that’s when I discovered CloudyML. I was already part of their Telegram channel, where they shared job openings and daily learning Q&A. After filling out the form on their website, I got a chance to discuss which course would suit me best.

CloudyML offers three self-taught data science courses, and later, they introduced a live lecture option. The courses are:
* Data Analytics Program (Basic)
* Data Science & Analytics Program (Intermediate)
* Data Superstar Program (Advanced, includes Data Engineering)

After a 30-40 minute discussion with their team, I decided to go with the second option—Data Science & Analytics Program. Why? Because the first one was too basic (many concepts are already available on YouTube), and the third included Data Engineering, which wasn’t my immediate goal. The second program covered ML, Cloud Web Services, and AI—skills I believed would be crucial for future Data Analyst roles.

I paid ₹13,159 and started my course on March 14, 2024.

### My Course Breakdown: From Zero to Hero

**Phase 1: The Orientation**

First, they hit us with the basics:
* Roadmap of a data analyst/scientist – what to expect, how to climb the ladder
* How teaching assistance works (lifesaver for doubts)
* Live doubt support – where to scream for help when stuck
* Quick intro to SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, Power BI – just enough to tease us
* ML, DL, Stats – a sneak peek, not deep-dive yet
* How to apply for resume checks, internships, placements – the real deal
* WhatsApp community – where the real hustle happens (assignments, job posts, memes)
* Assignments – how to download, do them, and upload without messing up
* Certificates – because LinkedIn flex is mandatory
* Resume & LinkedIn setup – because no one hires if you look like a noob
* Mock interviews – HR rounds, technical grilling, how not to blank out
* Job portals – where to spam applications  

**Phase 2: The Technical Grind Begins**

1. AI & Data Science Basics  
Got the 101 on AI, ML, DL, NLP, Computer Vision, enough to sound smart in interviews.  

2. Python – From Zero to Hero
* Basics: Variables, loops, functions – yawn, but necessary
* Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dicts – the bread and butter
* File Handling & Regex: Because real data is messy AF
* Pandas, NumPy: Where the magic happens (data cleaning, EDA)
* Leetcode/Hackerrank: Because interviews love to torture
* Case Studies & Quiz: Prove you didn’t just sleep through it

3. MS Excel - The OG Data Tool
* Basic to Pro: From VLOOKUP to Macros & VBA
* Pivot Tables: The gateway drug to analytics
* Dashboards: Make pretty charts so managers think you’re a wizard
* VBA Scripting: Automate stuff and pretend you’re a hacker 

4. SQL - The Database Boss
* DDL, DML, Joins: How to not corrupt a database
* CTEs, Stored Procedures: Fancy ways to avoid messy queries
* Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() – because sorting is life
* Pivots, Unpivots: Turn tables inside out
* Case Studies: Real-world problems, real headaches

5. Power BI –The Fancy Viz Tool
* DAX Formulas: The Excel formulas on steroids
* M Language: For when DAX isn’t enough pain
* RLS (Row-Level Security): Hide data from nosy people
* Star Schema, Snowflake: Fancy names for "organize your damn data"
* AI in Power BI: Because why not? 

6. Tableau – Optional But Done Anyway
Since Power BI is enough, I just speedran Tableau —basic plots, filters, dashboards (time bachaya, certificate pakda).  

7. Stats – The Real Interview Savior 
Skipped calculus, linear algebra (data analyst role mein itna torture nahi) and focused on:  
* Probability, Distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson—yaad kar lo)  
* Hypothesis Testing (p-values, t-tests, ANOVA—interview staple)  
* Skewness, Kurtosis (because data bhi narcissistic hota hai)

**Phase 3: Grind Mode Activated**

Alright, so I finished all the modules—now what? Time to lock in for the data analyst role. Here’s how I went from "I kinda get it" to "I’m ready for interviews":

* Daily Revision – No fancy tricks, just one module per day. SQL on Monday, Power BI on Tuesday—rinse, repeat.
* Projects, Projects, Projects – Because theory without practice = resume in the trash. Built dashboards, cleaned messy datasets, automated Excel reports—you name it.
* Extra Skills on the Side – Every 8th or 9th day, I’d peek into:
    - Machine Learning Basics (Just enough to not sound clueless)
    - Google Data Studio (Because why stick to just Power BI?)
    - General Aptitude (For those sneaky "logical reasoning" interview questions)
* The Timeline – Took me 8 months total (No shortcuts, just consistent grind).
* The Result? Applied for internships, landed an interview—and finally got one. 

**Final Verdict?**  

Bohot mehnat lagi, but worth it! Now I can actually answer SQL joins without sweating, make dashboards without crying, and explain p-values without stuttering.  

**Certificate mil gaya?** 
**Internship/placement ka process shuru?**
**Ab bas job ka intezaar…**
